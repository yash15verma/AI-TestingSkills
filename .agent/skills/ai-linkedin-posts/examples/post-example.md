Coding without AI in 2026 is like writing a book without an eraser.
You’re not just moving slower—you’re falling behind.

AI is no longer "optional" for modern engineering teams.
It’s the difference between shipping features and fixing legacy debt.

The reality? Gartner predicts 70% of coding will be AI-assisted by next year.

Here is how to stay ahead:
- Use AI for boilerplate—focus your brain on architecture.
- Treat your LLM as a junior dev, not a senior lead.
- Rapidly prototype, but selectively commit.

The goal isn’t to replace the dev. It’s to replace the friction.
